        <p>Suresh Raina[5] (pronunciationⓘ; born 27 November 1986[6]) is an Indian former international cricketer.[7] He occasionally served as stand-in captain for Indian men's national cricket team as well as in IPL for Chennai Super Kings during the absence of the main captain, MS Dhoni. He played for Uttar Pradesh (UP) in domestic cricket circuit.Raina rose to become the captain of the Uttar Pradesh U-16s and came to prominence amongst Indian selectors in 2002 when he was selected at the age of 15+1⁄2 years for the U-19 tour to England, where he made a pair of half-centuries in the U-19 Test matches.[20] He toured Sri Lanka later that year with the U-17 team.

        <h3 id="rt">Rohit</h3>
        <p>In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma joined the Mumbai Indians for $2 million and scored his first and only IPL century that year. He was appointed captain of the Mumbai Indians in 2013 and led them to five titles (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020). He also led them to the Champions League T20 title in 2013.Sharma’s international career kicked off with an ODI match against Ireland at Belfast in June 2007, when he took one catch but did not get a chance to bat or bowl. His T20I debut was later the same year, in the group game against England in the first T20I World Cup. Again, he didn’t get a chance to bat or bowl but took one catch, in a match remembered for Yuvraj Singh’s six sixes in an over. Sharma was Player of the Match in the quarterfinals against South Africa. He was also part of the team that won the T20I World Cup final, scoring a quick 30, the second highest score for India.

            Sharma scored his first ODI half-century in November 2007 and had a run of good scores in the 2007–08 ODI series in Australia, which India won. He scored two ODI hundreds in 2010 but subsequently had a loss of form and fitness, which led to him being dropped from the eventually victorious 2011 ODI World Cup team. His loss of form continued for a couple of years, and he continued to be in and out of the team.
            
            It was in 2013 that the captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, promoted Sharma as opener, a position at which he has been a success. His partnership with Shikhar Dhawan at the top of the order has yielded great results for India. He scored his first ODI double hundred against Australia the same year and followed it up with a second double hundred against Sri Lanka in 2014. The latter score of 264 remains an ODI record for highest individual score. Sharma made his Test debut in 2013, scoring 177 against West Indies in Kolkata, in Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell series. He was, however, unable to hold his position in the Test team for a few years after a run of poor scores in overseas Test matches.</p>

        <h4 id="vk">kohli</h4>
        <p>Virat Kohli was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India. He grew up in Delhi and was one of the first to train at the West Delhi Cricket Academy, created in 1998. In 2002 he played for the Delhi Under-15 team and was the highest run scorer in the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy, playing for the Delhi Under-17 team.In February 2006 Kohli made his domestic debut for Delhi in a one-day match against Services (a team representing the Indian armed forces) but did not get a chance to bat. He scored only 10 runs in his first-class debut (first-class cricket refers to matches that last three or more days and feature two sides of 11 players each) against Tamil Nadu in November that year. He scored 90 runs in difficult conditions in a first-class match against Karnataka in December, helping Delhi draw the Test. In April 2007 he scored 35 runs in his T20 domestic debut against Himachal Pradesh.

            Kohli captained the Under-19 Indian cricket team to victory at the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2008. His exploits were rewarded with an IPL contract from RCB for $30,000. He also made his international debut in an ODI that year, opening the batting and scoring 12 in a defeat of Sri Lanka in Dambulla, Sri Lanka. In 2009 he scored 405 runs in nine innings in the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia, ensuring that he would be at the top of the national team selectors’ minds.</p>
